- Ability to change baudrate using Up button, hold button to switch between baudrates (9600, 57600, 115200) (i set 57600 as default)
- Ok button will set backlight to always on mode, to disable press ok button again (it will restore default settings after app exit too)
- Long press Right button to change speed from knots to kilometers per hour
- Exit from app using long press on back button instead of short press, may be useful in case you want to turn backlight on and accidentally click back

**Note: To avoid issues with .dfu, prefer installing using .tgz with qFlipper, web updater or by self update package, all needed assets will be installed**

**Recommended option - Web Updater**

What means `n` or `e` in - `flipper-z-f7-update-(version)(n / e).tgz` ? - `n` means this build comes without our custom animations, only official flipper animations, 
`e` means build has extra apps pack preinstalled

Self-update package (update from microSD) - `flipper-z-f7-update-(version).zip` or download `.tgz` for mobile app / qFlipper
