**Note: To avoid issues with .dfu, prefer installing using .tgz with qFlipper, web updater or by self update package, all needed assets will be installed**

**Recommended option - Web Updater**

### What `n`, `r`, `e` means? What I need to download if I don't want to use Web updater?
What means `n` or `e` in - `flipper-z-f7-update-(version)(n / r / e).tgz` ? - `n` means this build comes without our custom animations, only official flipper animations, 
`e` means build has extra apps pack preinstalled,
`r` means RGB patch (+ extra apps) for flippers with rgb backlight mod (this is hardware mod!) (Works only on modded flippers!)

Self-update package (update from microSD) - `flipper-z-f7-update-(version).zip` or download `.tgz` for mobile app / qFlipper / web
