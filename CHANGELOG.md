**Note: To avoid issues with .dfu, prefer installing using .tgz with qFlipper, web updater or by self update package, all needed assets will be installed**

**Recommended option - Web Updater**

What means `n` or `e` in - `flipper-z-f7-update-(version)(n / e).tgz` ? - `n` means this build comes without our custom animations, only official flipper animations, 
`e` means build has extra apps pack preinstalled

Self-update package (update from microSD) - `flipper-z-f7-update-(version).zip` or download `.tgz` for mobile app / qFlipper
